This is the project for the final Exam for JS Web.

The REST API has been provided by SoftUni. I have writen everything inside the frontend folder.
In order to start the project you have to run two servers, one for the API and one for the frontend.
Run "nodemon index.js" in the restapi folder for the backend to start and then in the frontend folder run "npm start".
